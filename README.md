# minesweeper.rs
Minesweeper program that is written in Rust, my goal is to compile it for the web and have it run on some sort of graphics Library

So far the program only runs in the terminal

If you have the rust tool chain you can compile and run by simply using "cargo run" in the main directory

Use the "help" command once running to list all of the commands

TODO: 
  Implement win condition
  Don't generate mines in a 3x3 grid around the initial selection
  Implement "RESET" command
  Implement a timer
  Implement storing top scores
