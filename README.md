# minesweeper.rs
Minesweeper program that is written in Rust, my goal is to compile it for the web and have it run on some sort of graphics Library

So far the program only runs in the terminal

If you have the rust tool chain you can compile and run by simply using "cargo run" in the main directory

use the "help" command to list all of the commands
